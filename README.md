# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles.

## Installation

To install the dotfiles, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaphaeleL/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
make <os> # where <os> is the operating system you are using
```

This will copy the dotfiles to your home directory.

## TODO

- Create Symlinks instead of copying files
- Install the necessary stuff for each OS
