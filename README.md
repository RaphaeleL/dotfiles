# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles.

## Usage 

To install the dotfiles, run `make auto`. This will automatically install the dotfiles and set up the necessary configurations. If you want to check the status of the dotfiles, run `make status`. However, with `make help`, you can see all the available commands and their descriptions.
