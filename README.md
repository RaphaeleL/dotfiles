# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and dependencies for various operating systems and window managers. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient way to set up a development environment across different platforms, just with one Command.

## Installation 

Make sure you have [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed, the rest of the dependencies will be installed automatically.

## Usage 

To install the dotfiles, run `make auto`. This will automatically install the dotfiles and set up the necessary configurations. If you want to check the status of the dotfiles, run `make status`. However, with `make help`, you can see all the available commands and their descriptions.

## TODO

- Linux: Support for more Linux Distros ([Arch](https://archlinux.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), etc.)
- Linux: More X11 Window Manager ([AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/), [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/), etc.)
- Linux: Setup some [Wallpaper](https://github.com/RaphaeleL/wallpaper)
- MacOS: Auto Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Windows: Support for Windows 
- All: More Tools like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
